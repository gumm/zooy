## [35.3.0] - 2025-10-22

### Changed
- **Build System Migration**: Migrated from Rollup to Vite for faster builds and better DX
  - Build time improved by 44% (2.91s â†’ 1.63s)
  - Simplified configuration with modern defaults
- **Minification**: Replaced Terser with esbuild
  - Faster minification with better tree-shaking
  - Bundle sizes reduced by 14-27% across all outputs
  - Removed 10 unnecessary dependencies
- **Project Structure**: Modernized output directory structure
  - Build outputs now go to `dist/` directory (not committed to git)
  - Dual format support: `dist/zooy.es.js` (ES modules) and `dist/zooy.cjs.js` (CommonJS)
  - Updated `package.json` with proper `exports` field for Node.js compatibility
  - Added `files` field to control npm package contents
- **Documentation**: Updated all documentation to reflect new build system
  - Updated README.md with correct paths and bundle sizes
  - Cleaned up project structure documentation
  - Removed obsolete build scripts

### Removed
- Rollup and related plugins (`@rollup/plugin-*`)
- Terser minifier (replaced by esbuild)
- `build/` directory containing obsolete linting scripts
- `rollup.config.js` (replaced by `vite.config.js`)

### Added
- Vite build system with library mode configuration
- Modern package.json exports for better module resolution
- Updated bundle size metrics:
  - Core framework: ~101KB (~27KB gzipped)
  - MDC library: ~463KB (~62KB gzipped)
  - Carbon library: ~34KB (~7KB gzipped)

## [35.2.0] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Carbon Modal Component Detection**: Fixed `scanForCarbonComponents()` to check the panel element itself, not just descendants. Previously, when a panel WAS a Carbon component (e.g., `<cds-modal>`), it would not be initialized because `querySelectorAll()` only finds descendants.
- **Carbon Modal Close Events**: Carbon modals now properly emit `destroy_me` event on all close methods (close button, ESC key, backdrop click). Fixed by always emitting `destroy_me` regardless of template attributes.
- **Form Submission with Footer Buttons**: Submit buttons can now be placed outside forms using HTML5 `form` attribute. Button renderer now checks both `button.closest('form')` and `button.getAttribute('form')` to find associated forms.

### Added
- **Carbon Modal Footer Support**: Added initialization for `cds-modal-footer-button` with same form submission handling as `cds-button`
- **HTML5 Form Association**: Carbon buttons now support HTML5 `form="form-id"` attribute for buttons outside form elements
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging for Carbon modal initialization and event handling (temporary, for development)

### Changed
- Carbon button renderer now handles buttons outside form boundaries via HTML5 form attribute
- Modal close events are no longer configurable - modals MUST destroy their panel when closed

## [35.1.1] - 2025-10-16

### Removed
- Removed unused panel event handlers:
  - `search_by_qdict` from SearchHandlers
  - `add_q_dict_kv` from QueryParamHandlers
  - `remove_q_dict_k` from QueryParamHandlers
  - `nav_back` from NavigationHandlers (entire module removed)

### Added
- Added comprehensive handler migration guide (`docs/migration/HANDLER_MIGRATION.md`)
- Organized documentation into structured `docs/` directory:
  - `docs/architecture/` - Architecture documentation
  - `docs/migration/` - Migration guides
  - `docs/guides/` - Usage guides
- Added standard project files (LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Changed
- Exported handler collections through public API (`zooy.handlers`)
- Sanitized documentation files for developer use (removed progress tracking)

## [35.1.0] - 2025-10-16

### Changed
- Refactored panel event handlers into composable, opt-in collections
- Extracted MDC-specific handlers into separate modules
- Updated View class to use new handler collection pattern

### Added
- Handler collection system:
  - `MdcTreeHandlers` - MDC tree component handlers
  - `SearchHandlers` - Search and filter handlers
  - `QueryParamHandlers` - URL query parameter handlers
  - `DialogHandlers` - Dialog/modal handlers
  - `FormHandlers` - Form submission handlers
- `addHandlers()` helper method for composing handler collections

## [35.0.0] - 2025

### Added
- Component Library Registry system for pluggable UI libraries
- Carbon Design System integration (IBM Carbon Web Components)
- Lazy-loading support for component libraries
- Dynamic component imports with caching
- Carbon icon sprite management
- Programmatic icon API

### Changed
- Refactored Panel to be component-library-agnostic
- Migrated from MDC-only to multi-library support
- Updated build system for code-splitting (Rollup)
- Improved bundling strategy (reduced initial bundle size)

### Deprecated
- Direct MDC integration (now isolated in `mdc/` modules)
- Tight coupling between Panel and component libraries

## Earlier Versions

Previous versions focused on MDC (Material Design Components) integration
and core framework features. See git history for detailed changes.
